# Sorting Visualizer


Visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library.

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts the elements of a list in a certain order. While there are a large number of sorting algorithms, in practical implementations a few algorithms.
In this implementation of sorting visualizer, we'll be looking at some of these sorting algorithms and visualize their working.
The sorting algorithms covered here are Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort.
 You can randomize the list and select any type of sorting algorithm to call on the list from the given options. Here, all sorting algorithms will sort the elements in ascending order .

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-
- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
